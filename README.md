Satellite imagery and population fluctuations 
Abstract
Dynamic measures of human populations are necessary for public health planning. Changes in human population sizes are rarely quantified at actionable scales, largely because they are extremely difficult to measure. This is particularly true in under-resourced communities. Satellite imagery can provide data to measure population dynamics where other data are insufficient. 
Using anthropogenic illumination from serial, daily satellite image captures, we quantified variations in urban populations at high spatial and temporal scales. We measured populations in four cities of Niger and one in Nigeria. We focused on these specific cities to find mechanistic drivers and solutions for seasonal measles outbreaks.
Satellite-derived measures of anthropogenic illumination demonstrated that 1) satellite imagery detected urban population fluctuations, 2) urban populations experienced regular seasonal fluctuations, dry season increases and rainy season decreases, and 3) these fluctuations were sufficient to drive seasonal measles outbreaks. We describe in detail the methodology for using satellite imagery of nighttime lights to quantify seasonal changes in urban populations.
